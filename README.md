# Technovative Task

To run this Project. First clone the project then go to the project folder then run these commands

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

N.B - I have faced CORS issue for the apis. Tried to solve in the docker config file and the connector backend. But those did not work out. The endpoints and there functionalities are written inside this frontend project. But could not test due to the CORS issue.
